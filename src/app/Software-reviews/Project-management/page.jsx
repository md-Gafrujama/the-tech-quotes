                collaborate on it. It's particularly useful for work with
                overlapping responsibilities or within integrated workflows.

                Asana's pricing structure is quite competitive, but if you
                require advanced features, you'll find them paywalled behind
                higher-tier plans. For mid-tier companies, Asana provides
                excellent value for money through its mid-tier plans, as they
                offer competent functionalities for their price.

                In addition to offering Scrum or Kanban boards and sprint
                planning tools, Jira stands out as the go-to choice for Agile
                teams because of its Agile reporting tools. Other PM tools
                require third-party integrations to generate these charts and
                graphs, but Jira offers these reporting tools as native
                features. These reporting tools help provide a detailed view of
                team performance through Agile-specific reports such as velocity
                charts, burndown charts, and cumulative flow diagrams.

                As part of the Atlassian ecosystem, Jira can integrate with

                directly link project documentation, requirements, and decision
                records to Jira issues and sprints. Additionally, by integrating
                with Atlassian’s control system, Agile teams can link commits,

                      Scheduling a project involves constructing a project
                      timeline, delegating tasks, and outlining the known
                      checkpoints within the project. Project management
                      software includes different types of scheduling features
                      that give teams alternative ways to visualize their
                      projects. While some project management tools use a
                      traditional calendar view, more complex solutions like
                      Gantt charts and horizontal project timelines help teams
                      break large or complicated projects into manageable tasks.
                      Scheduling features in a project management tool will help
                      your team go from a mind map to a project plan quickly by
                      giving insight into both time and resource management.

                    Forecasting features in PM tools use data from previous
                    projects to predict the time and resource management
                    considerations the team will need to complete the project.
                    This project manager software feature helps project managers
                    calculate the ROI of a project before significant resources
                    have been invested. Forecasting takes into account the time
                    spent on each task and the resources required to complete
                    each task relative to the organization’s budget constraints

                    Similar to forecasting, resource management features in
                    project management software help project managers visualize
                    where their business invests time, energy, and materials so
                    the business can assess or change their plan when unforeseen
                    challenges arise. It can be time-consuming to enter and set
                    up a detailed inventory of company and human resources, but
                    doing so allows project managers to anticipate bottlenecks
                    and allocate resources.

                    Although software that budgets for projects and businesses
                    comes in standalone versions, certain PM software vendors
                    include budgeting functions and expense tracking. These help
                    companies run multiple projects at the same time while
                    staying within budget. While budgeting software is somewhat
                    self-explanatory, expense and project tracking software can
                    provide PMs with the added benefit of knowing how team
                    members accrue expenses throughout the lifespan of the
                    project. Similar to time tracking, expense tracking provides
                    valuable data that can be used to forecast future project
                    costs and build budgets into upcoming project plans.

                    tracks the amount of time each project contributor spends on
                    their assigned tasks. Besides simply measuring productivity,
                    time-tracking software also builds an archive of valuable
                    data that can help businesses forecast completion dates for
                    similar tasks or projects in the future. Time tracking is
                    especially helpful when managing a remote team, contract
                    workers, or part-time employees. In combination with
                    collaboration features like messaging and alerts that
                    enhance the project planning and execution experience, time
                    tracking can keep the entire team on schedule.

                    Task management refers to the assignment of different
                    responsibilities to various members of the project team.
                    Being able to quickly determine who’s contributed to what
                    part of the project lets managers better identify
                    bottlenecks and stay on top of the project’s progress.

                    While the concept of task management is simple, the software
                    can be fairly robust. In the case of large, complex projects
                    or multiple projects that span different departments, tasks
                    are often interconnected or interdependent. Certain project
                    management programs geared towards these types of
                    undertakings feature the ability to assign tasks and
                    dependencies to tasks, helping managers determine where a
                    breakdown in productivity is occurring and assign the
                    necessary resources to fix the problem. These features have
                    increasingly added automation to speed the transition of
                    tasks among team members and across the project workflow.

                    Other common features of task management include notes,
                    tags, and linking between tasks to show dependencies. Adding
                    notes to a task helps keep track of individual changes to
                    the project or provide references for the strategy
                    associated with each task. Adding tags to tasks makes them
                    easier to filter and find through unlimited projects in the
                    management tool’s native search functionality. Linking tasks
                    reminds stakeholders of other dependent tasks, gives further
                    context to a single task, or provides context to
                    interdependent tasks in multiple projects.

                    Permission settings allow a project manager to decide who
                    can view, edit, or change tasks and functions within the
                    project. To manage a project effectively, a PM must
                    judiciously mete out permissions and access across the
                    software. Granular software permission settings help project
                    managers avoid having to track down the sources of
                    unauthorized changes to tasks or entire phases of the
                    project. Permission settings are especially important for
                    teams that administrate multiple projects across many
                    departments using the same software for project management.
                    Look for pre-set or role-based permission settings to manage
                    unlimited users efficiently from a single dashboard.

                    Task and workflow automation helps speed projects to
                    completion. The software is programmed to respond to a
                    defined event with an immediate response, saving time across
                    many areas. For example, project assets may be sent for
                    approval upon completion or alert notifications will be sent
                    if budgets exceed a pre-set threshold. Automation features
                    may also automatically schedule recurring tasks for
                    completion, which reduces the amount of manual work the
                    project manager is required to do on any given day.

                    to making mid-project pivots, especially if it’s presented
                    in a dashboard that can provide a quick visual reference. If
