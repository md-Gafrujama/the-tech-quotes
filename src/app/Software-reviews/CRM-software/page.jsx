                Rounding out the 4-star range on our list is NetSuite CRM from
                Oracle. If that name sounds familiar, it should: NetSuite was an
                internet pioneer back when the internet still ran on dial-up.
                These days, the brand (now owned by Oracle) continues to offer

                planning (ERP), accounting and financials, inventory tracking,
                and more. Organizations looking to use a single system to manage

                The overall design of Oracle NetSuite CRM also focuses on
                providing a comprehensive view of the customer lifecycle. While
                its interface and usability score moderately, the CRM’s strength
                lies in its ability to offer a 360-degree view of customers,
                integrating sales, customer service, and marketing effectively.

        intro: `Insightly’s design philosophy in its reporting and analytics features emphasizes simplicity and clarity. The platform allows users to easily create and customize reports, offering an experience that reduces the complexity often associated with data analysis.`,
        details: `Insightly pairs an easy-to-use interface with customizable reporting tools, making it ideal for businesses that need detailed insights without the complexity of more advanced systems. This makes Insightly particularly suitable for small to medium-sized businesses or those with limited resources for data analysis.

Despite the lower price tag compared to other software offering similar tools, it still boasts advanced reporting, allowing users to generate custom, in-depth reports revealing key business performance indicators.

Its dashboard visualization serves up crucial metrics at a glance, aiding quick, informed decisions. Coupled with precise sales forecasting, Insightly paints an accurate picture of future sales revenue. Plus, with smooth integration with platforms like Power BI and Excel, Insightly’s analytics game is seriously amplified.

For businesses that prioritize ease of use and straightforward data visualization, Insightly is a more suitable choice than Salesforce, which, while powerful, can be overwhelming for users new to CRM analytics. HubSpot also offers similar user-friendliness but may not match Insightly’s depth in customization options for reports.

Insightly might be a brand name you’re unfamiliar with, but rest assured, it has a quiver of features that’s just as full as some of the bigger names on this list. Automation options, project management, and plentiful integration options are just the beginning. What’s not a common bragging right is their robust analytics and reporting capabilities.

In many ways, Insightly doubles as business intelligence, providing extensive flexibility and functionality regarding data discovery and scrubbing; organizing and visualization; powerful analytics insights; and intuitive reporting options.

Insightly has even enhanced its reporting and analytics features recently, focusing on providing more customizable reporting options and integrating AI-driven insights.`,

        outro: `However, compared to competitors like Salesforce or Oracle NetSuite, Insightly’s advanced features like AI analytics and VOIP capabilities could be further developed. While it offers a solid foundation in CRM functionalities, expanding these advanced features could enhance its appeal to larger businesses or those with more complex CRM needs.`,

This integration provides a significant advantage for organizations already utilizing Google’s ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p className="text-black mb-4">
      The platform’s user interface closely resembles that of Google products, which reduces the learning curve for users familiar with Google Workspace. This design choice enhances user adoption and efficiency, as team members can navigate the CRM with minimal additional training.

      One of Copper’s key features is its ability to automatically capture emails and calendar events. This automation significantly reduces the need for manual data entry, a common pain point in CRM usage. By streamlining this process, Copper allows sales teams to focus more on relationship-building and less on administrative tasks.

      Copper CRM is particularly well-suited for small to mid-sized businesses looking to enhance their sales processes, contact management, and team collaboration. Its feature set, while comprehensive, is designed to be accessible and practical rather than overwhelming.

It provides the necessary tools to maintain customer relationships effectively, without the hassle and expense of more extensive systems. This focus on simplicity and affordability makes Less Annoying CRM a refreshing choice in the crowded CRM space.`,

    For CRM tools, the most foundational functionality is that of collecting and organizing contact information. At the very least, it needs to be a step up from simply dumping leads into a spreadsheet only to immediately be forgotten. Spreadsheets have their place, but they aren’t optimized for automation or to serve as living records. If a CRM can’t improve on manual data entry, manual data scrubbing, and manual retrieval, then it’s just Excel with extra steps.

    Contact management features in CRM and sales software, it should be noted, vary widely from system to system. But the common upgrades to functionality will likely look familiar to anyone who’s been using digital devices in the past two decades:

    By now, nearly everyone is familiar with the “This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes” line spoken to customers calling in to a business for support. Having a record of customer/client/lead interactions can be indispensable. And not just for maintaining excellent service, either.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    Using recorded calls, chats, and other communication, businesses can achieve a multitude of important objectives, including:

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>Improving effectiveness of staff training, onboarding, company policies, and more</li>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If benefits like these factor into your CRM and sales software choices, then be aware that some software includes functionality to support it, while some does not.

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Implementing new software systems can be difficult, and onboarding users only becomes more problematic when the system doesn’t play well with existing solutions in the workflow.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Some CRMs are built as part of a larger platform of business solutions, and are intended to be used as a holistic unit. This is a bit of a trade-off, and some cost-benefit evaluations will be needed to determine if a complete workflow overhaul will net positive or negative returns for the trouble.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    However, if maintaining the stability and functionality of other systems is of equal importance, then finding a CRM software that can integrate with them successfully is critical. Depending on what integrations are needed, there may be plug-ins or add-ons available already to users of the tool.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    For less common integrations, some more code-heavy API customization may be necessary. In these cases, it’s a good idea to ask which side of the client-vendor partnership will be building the integration.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    What should be avoided is the addition of a CRM that only further complicates workflows and requires additional manual processes to hold the system together.

  {/* Marketing Automation Paragraphs */}
  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Marketing automation is a specific example of the integration concerns above, but it merits its own spot on this list due to the amount of overlap between marketing and sales efforts. Like other sales-adjacent functions, there are a lot of advantages to having the CRM trigger automatic tasks such as sending confirmation emails, email nurture campaigns, and more.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Worst-case scenario, similar to what’s mentioned above, is that the new CRM complicates already existing processes, rather than integrating or replacing them. If your CRM or sales software adds another step in the process of, for example, sending outreach emails because staff members have to manually dig for contact info in the database, that’s a net loss.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    At the very least, the CRM should leave any existing processes intact and unhindered. Most likely, however, your organization will benefit from some form of integration, or a CRM that includes marketing automation features natively.

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Next in line for important functions in the sales process that may or may not be handled by sales team members are financials, such as quotes, invoices, and other AP/AR responsibilities. The same philosophy applies here as above. If an all-in-one solution upgrades your workflow, prioritize that aspect in your research.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If integration will suffice, then double-check with vendors for the specific platforms you need to be interoperable. Even if your current process is efficient enough currently, be sure that the CRM software doesn’t create additional headaches for anyone in the workflow.

  {/* Data Privacy Paragraphs */}
  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Cybersecurity is, arguably, a priority for every organization (or, at least it should be). Some verticals deal with higher risk than others, however, and may need additional security protocols for their CRM to protect themselves or even to comply with industry mandates.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    This is one that may require consulting with IT, InfoSec, or other I&O staff in the organization. Many of the technical details that factor into whether or not a CRM software is sufficiently secure may be outside the expertise of anyone without a background in computer systems, and it’s not one to leave to chance.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Check with internal SMEs, and leverage their experience to further vet your shortlist of CRMs. It may even be worthwhile to have a 3rd-party vendor risk assessment done for any that meet all other criteria, just to cover your bases.

  {/* Project Management Paragraphs */}
  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    This list of supplemental functions that might be relevant would be pretty long if it were comprehensive. All-in-one systems, analytics and reporting, ease of use, pipeline management, and many more might fit here. Many of these have been touched on above, and others are likely known quantities already.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    So instead, this part of the list will finish with one final consideration: project management.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Organizations that have, until now, used less formalized workflow processes may not realize how much of an upgrade a well-designed project management strategy can be. As teams grow, workloads become heavier, and processes become more intricate and complex, tracking things on paper proves a substantial challenge.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base sm:text-sm md:text-lg lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    With effective implementation, project management tools can provide visibility and accountability across the board. Better still, it can help staff achieve greater levels of autonomy by giving them the tools needed to stay organized and on top of their responsibilities. Some CRM and sales software tools include project management (PM) features in their toolset, while others can integrate with popular platforms via APIs. Either way, for any team larger than a handful of employees, it’s worth discussing the potential value a CRM with PM enablement might bring to the table.
