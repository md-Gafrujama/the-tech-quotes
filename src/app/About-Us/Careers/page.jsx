      title: "What are TA's core values?",
      content: `These are not just words on our website. Our core values are foundational to who we are as a company and the success of our team. We strive to achieve our highest potential and are dedicated to making a consistent effort to grow in these areas.

Be transparent
Being transparent is being honest and sharing the reality of a situation, even when it's hard to hear. Examples include:
- Asking for help and taking ownership when something isn't going as planned.
- Giving honest, constructive feedback to help each other learn and grow
- Proactively sharing information.
This results in every team member empowering one another and aligning within and across departments to do their best work.

Challenge mediocrity
Challenging mediocrity is bringing ideas to the table. Improving an imperfect process. Examples include:
- Thinking outside the box.
- Questioning "why?" with the intent to improve.
- Working harder, smarter, and more efficiently than the status quo.
The result is that our team, company, and clients improve every day.

Crave knowledge
Craving knowledge is asking questions and digging to find the best possible solutions. Examples include:
- Learning a new skill, language, talent, or hobby and not stopping there.
- Shadowing a team member who does something you're interested in learning more about.
- Identifying knowledge gaps within yourself and following your curiosity, because the more you know the more our business grows.
This results in our team continuously learning, growing, developing, and producing experts in our field.

Make calculated decisions
Making calculated decisions is analyzing trends and diving deeper into your knowledge base. Examples include:
- Leaning on data to support your research and ideas.
- Looking for ways to improve efficiency and processes where they lack.
- Thinking 3 steps ahead and staying agile as you navigate new paths.
This results in our team using facts, data, and intelligence to guide our business, making us well-rounded and prepared for contingencies.

Value each other
Valuing each other is doing something to make someone else's day more productive or fulfilling because when one of us wins, we all win. Examples include:
- Pitching in with administrative or project tasks.
- Giving back to our community through both financial contributions and volunteering our time.
- Recognizing and speaking kindly about one another.
- Supporting one another both personally and professionally.
This results in our team being friendly, genuine, welcoming, helpful, attentive, and willing to roll up our sleeves for the greater good.`,

      title: "What makes someone thrive at TA?",
      content: `A growth mindset
Our team is dedicated to growth and actively seeks opportunities to learn and develop. We see failure as lessons learned. We stay curious and expand our knowledge and skill sets beyond our current capabilities.

Adaptability
We are always ready to embrace new information and pivot our focus. We are a fast-growing, privately held company and base our decisions on constant feedback and data. Our plans and goals will change so we welcome opportunities for our roles and responsibilities to adapt with us.

A team-first mentality
We help each other out and organize our days with the big picture in mind. We all work toward a common goal, prioritizing collaboration and open communication. We don't let titles, location, gender, background, etc. define who gets invited to the table. Your voice and authentic individual ideas are valued and taken seriously.

Intrinsic motivation
We are self-starters and find motivation naturally. We are driven, hold ourselves accountable, and require minimal oversight to remain productive and committed. Due to this, we provide flexibility and autonomy day to day while trusting team members to communicate accordingly. We know what is needed to get the job done.

Resiliency
We navigate ambiguous situations and find innovative ways to overcome challenges regardless of our limitations. Instead of limiting ourselves with "I can't", "I don't know how", or "Is it possible?", we ask ourselves "What would it take?"

Proactivity
We go beyond the immediate tasks at hand to push our goals forward. We expect everyone to be proactive, take initiative to make the most of their work week, spot opportunities for improvement, and take it upon themselves to enact change or make something better.`,
    },
    {
      title: "What is TA's work environment like?",
      content: `Engaging
We believe work is more fun when you know and are known by the people you work with. This can look like being a mentor, directly messaging a colleague to tell them they did a good job, sharing in a meeting, or helping someone out when they need it most. With events like an annual company talent show and virtual happy hours, we don't take ourselves too seriously and encourage one another through life's ups and downs.

Fast-paced
We move fast! We have a bias toward taking action and value progress over perfection. Projects and tasks move quickly providing you a way to make an increased impact. We pivot often based on business needs and thrive where we embrace the unknown. We're all about getting out of our comfort zones, introducing new ideas, and questioning the status quo. There will be learning opportunities when we're innovating and moving fast!

Supportive
Growth varies for everyone, and we're here to support you, whether you're an individual contributor or a leader. You will have opportunities to develop new skills, carve your own niche in the business, participate in one of our Employee Resource Groups, ascend to a leadership role, or explore new paths within the organization. We're invested in your career journey however that looks.

Global
Our workforce spans the globe across four continents, representing a rich tapestry of cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. We enjoy the benefits of cross-cultural collaboration, an array of global perspectives, language diversity, and the commitment to cultural sensitivity. We are continuously adapting the way we work, communicate, collaborate, give back, and have fun, to align with being a remote-first organization.

Committed to DE&I
We recognize that diversity extends beyond the color of our skin to include ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, abilities, cultural backgrounds, experiences, and skills. Our way of operating is to allow our teammates to show up as themselves every day. We ask our team to equally respect individual differences, and do their best to embrace and amplify the shining light of others. We protect one another by creating inclusive, safe spaces and holding a high standard of trust and respect for individual contributors as well as leaders. By doing this, we have created an environment where people feel valued, trusted, and connected.`,

                  We help people who are in need of new or optimized tech (primarily software) for their business get unbiased advice and data that helps them make sound purchasing decisions.
                  We help technology companies connect with an exclusive audience of 100 million buyers to ease the burden of prospecting blindly and meet buyers on their terms. We shorten the sales cycle by doing the initial vetting and qualifying of a prospect.

After applying, you will receive a confirmation email from our applicant tracking system confirming your application has been received. We review every application that we receive but unfortunately are unable to respond to every applicant directly. We will reach out to qualified candidates with an update on the next step within 5 – 7 days. Typically, a member of our HR team will conduct a phone interview with qualified candidates.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Below is an overview of our standard hiring process and typical time commitment for each stage:
                  Phone Interview, 20 – 30 minutes 
                  Skills Assessment, approximately 2 hours (on task) 
                  Hiring Manager Interview, 60 – 90 minutes 
                  Test Drive, 3 – 4 hours 
                  Certain stages in the hiring process may be adjusted depending on the position or hiring manager.
                  What is a Test Drive?
                  Just like you wouldn't buy a car without test driving it first, we want candidates and future employees to have the opportunity to test their potential new role and company! You'll get a taste of a typical day and meet some of the team members you could work alongside!

                  It varies based on the position, but on average it takes around 2-3 weeks from when you apply to when an offer goes out. Our priority is always finding the right match rather than meeting a timeline. We want to ensure that not only are you a good fit for us but that we're also a good fit for you.
                  Be sure to keep your recruiter in the loop regarding any additional opportunities you are exploring so our recruitment team can work to accommodate your timeline and availability.
