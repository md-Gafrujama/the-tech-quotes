Our core values are foundational to who we are as a company and the success of our team. We strive to achieve our highest potential and are dedicated to making a consistent effort to grow in these areas.\n\nBe transparent\nBeing transparent is being honest and sharing the reality of a situation, even when it's hard to hear. Examples include:\n- Asking for help and taking ownership when something isn't going as planned.\n- Giving honest, constructive feedback to help each other learn and grow\n- Proactively sharing information.\nThis results in every team member empowering one another and aligning within and across departments to do their best work.\n\nChallenge mediocrity\nChallenging mediocrity is bringing ideas to the table. Improving an imperfect process. Examples include:\n- Thinking outside the box.\n- Questioning \"why?\" with the intent to improve.\n- Working harder, smarter, and more efficiently than the status quo.\nThe result is that our team, company, and clients improve every day.\n\nCrave knowledge\nCraving knowledge is asking questions and digging to find the best possible solutions. Examples include:\n- Learning a new skill, language, talent, or hobby and not stopping there.\n- Shadowing a team member who does something you're interested in learning more about.\n- Identifying knowledge gaps within yourself and following your curiosity, because the more you know the more our business grows.\nThis results in our team continuously learning, growing, developing, and producing experts in our field.\n\nMake calculated decisions\nMaking calculated decisions is analyzing trends and diving deeper into your knowledge base. Examples include:\n- Leaning on data to support your research and ideas.\n- Looking for ways to improve efficiency and processes where they lack.\n- Thinking 3 steps ahead and staying agile as you navigate new paths.\nThis results in our team using facts, data, and intelligence to guide our business, making us well-rounded and prepared for contingencies.\n\nValue each other\nValuing each other is doing something to make someone else's day more productive or fulfilling because when one of us wins, we all win. Examples include:\n- Pitching in with administrative or project tasks.\n- Giving back to our community through both financial contributions and volunteering our time.\n- Recognizing and speaking kindly about one another.\n- Supporting one another both personally and professionally.\nThis results in our team being friendly, genuine, welcoming, helpful, attentive, and willing to roll up our sleeves for the greater good.`,\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"What makes someone thrive at TA?\",\n      content: `A growth mindset\nOur team is dedicated to growth and actively seeks opportunities to learn and develop. We see failure as lessons learned. We stay curious and expand our knowledge and skill sets beyond our current capabilities.\n\nAdaptability\nWe are always ready to embrace new information and pivot our focus. We are a fast-growing, privately held company and base our decisions on constant feedback and data. Our plans and goals will change so we welcome opportunities for our roles and responsibilities to adapt with us.\n\nA team-first mentality\nWe help each other out and organize our days with the big picture in mind. We all work toward a common goal, prioritizing collaboration and open communication. We don't let titles, location, gender, background, etc. define who gets invited to the table. Your voice and authentic individual ideas are valued and taken seriously.\n\nIntrinsic motivation\nWe are self-starters and find motivation naturally. We are driven, hold ourselves accountable, and require minimal oversight to remain productive and committed. Due to this, we provide flexibility and autonomy day to day while trusting team members to communicate accordingly. We know what is needed to get the job done.\n\nResiliency\nWe navigate ambiguous situations and find innovative ways to overcome challenges regardless of our limitations. Instead of limiting ourselves with \"I can't\", \"I don't know how\", or \"Is it possible?\", we ask ourselves \"What would it take?\"\n\nProactivity\nWe go beyond the immediate tasks at hand to push our goals forward. We expect everyone to be proactive, take initiative to make the most of their work week, spot opportunities for improvement, and take it upon themselves to enact change or make something better.`,\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"What is TA's work environment like?\",\n      content: `Engaging\nWe believe work is more fun when you know and are known by the people you work with. This can look like being a mentor, directly messaging a colleague to tell them they did a good job, sharing in a meeting, or helping someone out when they need it most. With events like an annual company talent show and virtual happy hours, we don't take ourselves too seriously and encourage one another through life's ups and downs.\n\nFast-paced\nWe move fast! We have a bias toward taking action and value progress over perfection. Projects and tasks move quickly providing you a way to make an increased impact. We pivot often based on business needs and thrive where we embrace the unknown. We're all about getting out of our comfort zones, introducing new ideas, and questioning the status quo. There will be learning opportunities when we're innovating and moving fast!\n\nSupportive\nGrowth varies for everyone, and we're here to support you, whether you're an individual contributor or a leader. You will have opportunities to develop new skills, carve your own niche in the business, participate in one of our Employee Resource Groups, ascend to a leadership role, or explore new paths within the organization. We're invested in your career journey however that looks.\n\nGlobal\nOur workforce spans the globe across four continents, representing a rich tapestry of cultures, backgrounds, and perspectives. We enjoy the benefits of cross-cultural collaboration, an array of global perspectives, language diversity, and the commitment to cultural sensitivity. We are continuously adapting the way we work, communicate, collaborate, give back, and have fun, to align with being a remote-first organization.\n\nCommitted to DE&I\nWe recognize that diversity extends beyond the color of our skin to include ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, abilities, cultural backgrounds, experiences, and skills. Our way of operating is to allow our teammates to show up as themselves every day. We ask our team to equally respect individual differences, and do their best to embrace and amplify the shining light of others. We protect one another by creating inclusive, safe spaces and holding a high standard of trust and respect for individual contributors as well as leaders. By doing this, we have created an environment where people feel valued, trusted, and connected.`,\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Is TechnologyAdvice the company for you?\",\n      content: `We have big goals ahead and need an extraordinary team to achieve them, so if you read this and get just as excited as we are, the opportunities are endless!`,\n    },\n  ];\n\n const testimonials = [\n  {\n    text: `There are endless opportunities to explore and advance your career at TechnologyAdvice.
